Repackage the standalone dashboard as an Artifact-shaped page.

    python3 scripts/build_artifact.py   ->   dashboard.artifact.html

The Artifact host wraps the file it is given in its own
<!doctype html><head>…</head><body> skeleton, so the file must carry page
content only. This strips our own document wrapper and the meta and favicon
tags the skeleton already provides, keeps the <title>, <style> and <script>
blocks, and re-applies the RTL direction that used to live on <html>.

Nothing about the design changes: the brand palette, layout and copy are the
reviewed dashboard exactly as it ships in index.html.
